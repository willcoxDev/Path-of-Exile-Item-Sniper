Path of Exile Item Sniper.

This is an open source Item Sniper for Path of Exile. I uses PoE Stash API to continualy retrieve updates to players publics stash tabs everytime they are updated.
It then finds an item that you want to snipe and continually searches for that item each search. Once a match is found A sound will play and a message similar to "@lamarkhamar Hi I would like to buy your Velvet Gloves listed for ~b/o 1 chaos" will be copied to your clipboard where you can paste that into your game and go from there.
It currently uses roughly 0.5mb - 1mb of data each time a search is performed and searched are performed every second or so, therfore becareful of the amount of data you are using.

I made this open source because screw all the people who want to screw the average player.

This is a work in progress, features will be added as I find the time.
Right now all the bot does is take search terms and find them in the JSON file that is gathered from the Stash API. 
I do not suggest you use this as a final version but feel free to fork it.
